# Learning Management System  

This project was developed as part of a software development course, in collaboration with three other students. While not all of the code is mine, I contributed a substantial portion to the implementation.  

This is one of the largest projects I have worked on to date. It required teamwork, collaboration, and problem-solving to ensure smooth development and integration across different components.  

## Running the Project  

To run the project, you will need to modify the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to a database you have access to. Alternatively, you can use a local database, such as the one provided by VS Code.  

For security reasons, I have removed the login credentials for my school's database. I appreciate your understanding regarding this decision.
